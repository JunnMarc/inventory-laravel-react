# Laravel Inventory System + React Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This project utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) component libraries.
